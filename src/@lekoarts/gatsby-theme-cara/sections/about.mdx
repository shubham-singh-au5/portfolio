## About Me

##### I am obsessed with making things and even more obsessed with making things better. I've started making Wordpress websites for small businesses since I was 18. I never charged any money and just wanted to showoff my skills. I have been actively involved in the web developer community for the last 6 years.
##### My speciality is front-end web design and development, making pixel magic and turning it into beautiful and semantic HTML & CSS. My interests, however, extends beyond the web and I love helping people in making prototypes for their ideas.
##### When I am not coding, I am probably hanging out with my friends, playing football and cricket, reading business books or messing around on something inspired by Steve Jobs. I dream of becoming CEO of my own company and making it a unicorn on its way.

##### Skills - HTML, CSS, React, Redux, Node, Express, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Bootstrap, Material-UI, Materialize-CSS
